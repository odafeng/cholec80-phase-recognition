# Master Results — BUA across 4 backbones × 3 online heads (Cholec80 test)

5 seeds, paired Wilcoxon with **Holm–Bonferroni** correction. Baseline = raw online
head; +BUA = boundary head + boundary-weighted loss + temperature + uncertainty-
aware causal smoothing. All heads verified **strictly causal** (test_causality.py).
A 5th backbone (self-trained surgical MAE) is pretraining and will be added.

> These numbers supersede an earlier draft: a LoViT causality bug (GroupNorm over
> the time axis) had inflated LoViT-online accuracy by leaking future frames, and a
> latency-metric bug under-reported latency. Both are fixed; LoViT was re-trained
> and everything re-evaluated. The corrected LoViT online accuracies are
> appropriately lower (e.g. EndoViT LoViT 83.8→74.3 base), and latencies are now
> honest (6–10 s, not 1–2 s).

## What the matrix shows (after the causality/metric fixes)

1. **The failure modes are universal.** Every baseline (12 cells) over-segments
   (3.8–9.8× the GT segment count) and is badly mis-calibrated at boundaries
   (boundary-ECE 22–46%). Frame accuracy hides both. Holds across CNN, surgical
   ViT, fine-tuned ViT, and end-to-end backbones → a temporal-decoding problem, not
   a feature-quality problem.

2. **BUA fixes them.** Over-segmentation improves **12/12** (down to 1.9–5.9×),
   F1@10 improves **12/12** (+11 to +25 pts), boundary-ECE improves **11/12** (lone
   exception: EndoViT-ft TeCNO, already the best-calibrated baseline at 21.7).

3. **Accuracy is preserved on strong backbones; two weak/edge cells regress.** With
   Holm correction, BUA accuracy is non-inferior on **10/12** cells (and *improves*
   EndoViT-pretrained LoViT 74.3→78.3). Two cells are significantly worse: EndoViT-
   pretrained ASFormer (70.7→68.4, the weakest combo) and EndoViT-ft LoViT
   (87.7→87.1). Both are recoverable by the val-selected gentler smoothing operating
   point (gamma≈0.3) — reported as a trade-off curve.

4. **Latency is honest (6–10 s) and BUA's effect is small/mixed.** The smoothing
   adds at most a couple of seconds (sometimes reduces it, e.g. ResNet50 ASFormer
   10.1→8.1, e2e LoViT 6.9→6.6). The earlier scary 2.4→4.2 s "regression" was an
   artifact of the buggy latency metric and no longer stands.

5. **Backbone ranking (best baseline head).** end-to-end (ASFormer 90.1 / LoViT
   90.4) ≳ ResNet50 (TeCNO 89.1) ≈ EndoViT-ft (88.8) ≫ EndoViT-pretrained (78.7).
   End-to-end gives the strongest backbone, but reliability problems persist at every
   backbone strength — reinforcing #1.

## Rigor / honesty notes
- All online heads pass a prefix-invariance causality test (no future leakage).
- p-values are Holm-corrected across the ~15-metric family.
- Smoothing operating point selected on val, never test.
- Self-trained MAE backbone (videos 1–40 only) will add a 5th, contamination-free row.

## Corrected statistics (P4, `stats_corrected.py` → `results/stats_corrected.json`)
Per-(video, seed) analysis, no seed pre-averaging; cluster-bootstrap 95% CIs over the
40 test videos; paired Wilcoxon Holm-corrected across the metric family; TOST
non-inferiority (1% margin).
- **Boundary-region ECE vs interior (headline metric):** 0.314 vs 0.073 →
  **4.32× [3.73, 5.12]**, Wilcoxon **p=2.8e-21** (n=120 video×head units). The
  boundary-localised mis-calibration is real and not an averaging artefact.
- **Baseline (argmax) pooled (5 bb × 3 heads × 5 seeds):** acc 0.773 [0.747, 0.800],
  over-seg 6.2× [5.1, 7.7], F1@10 32.3 [28.9, 35.8], median latency 25.6 s.
- **BUA heuristic vs baseline (Holm):** significant ↑ on F1@10 (+19.6), edit (+17.6),
  over-seg (+3.3×), accuracy (+0.011), false-starts; **latency NOT significant**
  (Δ=−0.3 s, p_holm=0.90) — the axis QCD targets. TOST: accuracy non-inferior
  (CI_lo +0.5%).
- **Pending (GPU-blocked behind LLM benchmark):** Trans-SVNet/Surgformer baselines;
  per-video CIs for QCD frontier operating points (need cached posteriors / re-inference).
